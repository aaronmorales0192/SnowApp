            <p id="generalText">
            Welcome to our Snow Forecasting App! This app helps users check their chances of snowfall 
            up to 5 days in advance across the United States. Additionally, students and teachers 
            can estimate the likelihood of a snow day based on their location and the current forecast.

            Our forecast data is collected from the Open-Meteo Weather API, which provides live hourly 
            forecasts using a variety of deterministic weather models and weather model ensembles.  
            Location data comes from the Nominatim/OpenStreetMap public API, which offers precise coordinates 
            for cities across the United States.

            <p id="useText">
            Simply enter your city and state. Using live weather data and the location of the forecast, 
            our algorithm determines your chance of snow and school cancellations. While we can't guarantee 
            official decisions from your school district, we provide an estimate based on live weather data 
            to keep you informed.
