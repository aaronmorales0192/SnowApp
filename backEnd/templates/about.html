                Welcome to our <b>Snow Forecasting App</b>! This app helps users check their chances of snowfall 
                up to 5 days in advance across the United States. Additionally, students and teachers 
                can estimate the likelihood of a snow day based on their location and the current forecast.

                Our forecast data is collected from the <i>Open-Meteo Weather API</i>, which provides live hourly 
                forecasts using the GFS (Global Forecasting System) weather model ensembles.  
                Location data comes from the <i>Nominatim/OpenStreetMap public API</i>, which offers precise coordinates 
                for cities across the United States.

                Simply enter your city and state! Using live weather data and the location of the forecast, 
                our algorithm determines your chance of snow and school cancellations. While we can't guarantee 
                official decisions from your school district, we provide an estimate based on live weather data 
                to keep you informed.
